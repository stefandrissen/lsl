# SAM Coupé Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards

An attempt at a SAM Coupé Z80 implemenation of AGI ([Adventure Game Interpreter](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=AGI)) as used by Sierra in their early adventure games.

The data files used are from the original PC version, downloaded from [myabandonware.com](http://www.myabandonware.com/game/leisure-suit-larry-in-the-land-of-the-lounge-lizards-bl).

For now all it does is draw and show the rooms one by one.
